# 32-bit Floating Point Unit (FPU) - Design and UVM Verification

This project implements and verifies a 32-bit IEEE-754 compliant Floating Point Unit (FPU) using Verilog/SystemVerilog. The FPU supports key arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, It is functionally verified using a UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) testbench.
